# 🚀 Sentiment Prediction for Mental Health Using BERT

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **sentiment analysis for mental health-related statements** using **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**. The model is trained to classify statements into different sentiment categories, providing insights into how language reflects mental health status.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle - *Sentiment Analysis for Mental Health*
- **Size**: 50,000 statements
- **Preprocessing**: Tokenization using BERT tokenizer

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)**
- **PyTorch/TensorFlow**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)

## 📊 Key Insights
- Training took **28 hours** due to the computational cost of processing text tokens.
- **Attention weights visualization** reveals key words influencing sentiment classification.
- The model effectively identified words like **"restless"** as key indicators of negative sentiment.

## 📈 Results & Visualizations
- **Confusion Matrix** and **Classification Report** included in results.
- **Attention Weights Plot** showcases how BERT prioritizes certain words in classification.

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- Fine-tuning on more diverse datasets.
- Experimenting with **GPT-based models** for improved contextual understanding.
- Exploring applications of **AI in the Oil & Gas industry**.
